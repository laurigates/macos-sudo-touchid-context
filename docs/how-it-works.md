# How it works

Findings behind this module, with the evidence for each. Source citations are to
Apple's published code: [`apple-oss-distributions/pam_modules`][pam_modules] at tag
`pam_modules-217.100.6` and [`apple-oss-distributions/OpenPAM`][openpam] at tag
`OpenPAM-35` (the latest tags when this was written, October 2026). Observations
are from macOS 26.6.2 (25G83) on Apple silicon. That the shipped binaries match
those tags is an assumption; the probe results below are consistent with it.

## Why Apple's dialog cannot show the command

`modules/pam_tid/pam_tid.c` in `pam_modules`:

- It reads only the PAM user (`pam_get_user`). Its own `argc`/`argv` are the
  option words from the `pam.d` line, and it ignores them. Nothing about sudo's
  command reaches it.
- It checks Touch ID is usable with `LAEvaluatePolicy` and `kLAOptionNotInteractive`
  (no UI), passing the user's uid in `kLAOptionUserId` (lines 110–148).
- The dialog itself comes from `AuthorizationCopyRights` on the right
  `com.apple.security.sudo`, called with `kAuthorizationEmptyEnvironment`
  (lines 150–161). The environment is where a caller would put custom prompt
  text. The dialog is built from the calling process name (`sudo`) and the
  right's definition, which on a stock system has no `default-prompt`
  (`security authorizationdb read com.apple.security.sudo`). On macOS 26.6 it
  reads "sudo is trying to execute a command as administrator."
- The right's rule is `entitled` and `authenticate-session-owner` (`k-of-n` 2, so
  both must pass). A process without sudo's entitlement is refused without UI.
  Loading `pam_tid.so.2` into the test harness (copied as `sudo`) showed no
  dialog, and authd logged `Failed to authorize right 'com.apple.security.sudo'
  by client '…/sudo'`. That is why `just screenshot stock` needs real
  `/usr/bin/sudo` with `pam_tid.so` active.
- In `sudo -A` (askpass) mode it returns `PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL` without UI
  (lines 102–108), so sudo falls through to the password via the askpass helper.

So no argument, environment variable or `-p` prompt that a caller such as
Homebrew gives sudo can change the dialog. Changing it needs a different module.

## How this module gets the command into the dialog

`LAContext -evaluatePolicy:localizedReason:reply:` is the public LocalAuthentication
API; the dialog renders as "<process> is trying to <localizedReason>". A PAM
module runs inside the sudo process, so it can read:

- **sudo's own argv** via `sysctl(KERN_PROCARGS2)` on `getpid()`. The command is
  everything after `--` (Homebrew's form: `/usr/bin/sudo [-A] -E -- <cmd>`), or
  after sudo's leading options otherwise. With no command (`sudo -s`, `-v`)
  sudo's flags are shown.
- **the requester** by walking parent pids (`KERN_PROC_PID` → `e_ppid`). Inline
  shell wrappers (`sh`/`bash`/`zsh … -c`) are skipped and listed as "via"; a
  shell running a script file is kept, because the file name identifies it. For
  an interpreter (`ruby`, `python`, `perl`, `node`, …) the interpreter and its
  flags are dropped so the script names the requester.
- Absolute paths in the requester are shortened to their last component. The
  command keeps full paths, since those are what is being authorized. The
  reason is capped at 160 characters; the dialog wraps long text at `/` and
  showed a ~150-character reason in full.

Third-party modules that use the same API exist (for example
[`biscuitehh/pam-watchid`](https://github.com/biscuitehh/pam-watchid)); they pass a
fixed `reason=` option from the `pam.d` line.

## Touch ID inside sudo: evaluate as the invoking user

sudo is setuid root, so a module calling `LAContext` runs with euid 0, and
`coreauthd` evaluates the policy **for root**. The first in-sudo run failed
without a dialog; the unified log showed why:

```
coreauthd … ContextProxy[…] created for Context[…] uid:0
coreauthd … evaluatePolicy … returned Error Domain=com.apple.LocalAuthentication
  Code=-7 "No identities are enrolled."
```

The same code had worked from a test program running as the user. Apple's
`pam_tid` avoids this with the private `kLAOptionUserId`. This module uses public
API only: it calls `seteuid(getuid())` for the duration of the evaluation and
restores the saved euid afterwards (a setuid process may switch between its real
and saved ids). If restoring fails it calls `abort()` rather than continue in
sudo with the wrong euid.

Before prompting it requires that the PAM user, the real uid (who ran sudo) and
the console user (`SCDynamicStoreCopyConsoleUser`) are the same account, because
`LAContext` authenticates whoever is at the console, not the PAM user. Without
that check another account running sudo in your GUI session could be approved
with your fingerprint.

## A module that fails to load locks sudo

In OpenPAM, a module that cannot be loaded makes the whole service fail to
configure. The control flag (`sufficient`, `optional`) is never consulted, and
lines already loaded do not help.

From `openpam/lib/` at `OpenPAM-35`:

1. `openpam_configure.c:216–219`: each module is loaded while its line is
   parsed. On `NULL` the parser jumps to `fail` and returns `-1`.
2. `openpam_configure.c:181–184`: an `include` (sudo includes `sudo_local`)
   passes a `-1` from the included file up.
3. `openpam_configure.c:376–397`: `openpam_configure` clears every loaded chain
   and returns `PAM_SYSTEM_ERR`.
4. `pam_start.c:73–85`: `pam_start` fails. Its fallback to a hard-coded stock
   Apple chain applies only to processes flagged `CS_INSTALLER`, not to sudo.

A missing policy **file** is different: `openpam_read_chain_from_path` treats
`ENOENT` as an empty file (`openpam_configure.c:267–271`), so a missing
`sudo_local` is harmless.

Observed with `tests/probe_load.c` against the system libpam (return value =
module lines loaded, `-1` = rejected):

```
control: stock pam_tid.so          -> 1
missing, sufficient                -> -1
missing, optional                  -> -1
stock line, then missing optional  -> -1
```

sudo reports any load failure as `sudo: unable to initialize PAM: No such file or
directory`. Reports of it, first-hand:
[pam-watchid#26](https://github.com/biscuitehh/pam-watchid/issues/26) (comment of
2023-12-11: "Adding this plugin and enabling it in sudo_local breaks sudo
completely"). Others describe the same message for a wrong architecture where the
file existed, so the text does not identify the cause.

Ways to hit it: the module file is deleted while the line remains (uninstall in
the wrong order), a wrong path, a module built for the other architecture (this
project builds universal arm64 + x86_64), or a relative path. A path without a
leading `/` is looked up under OpenPAM's module directory
(`openpam_dynamic.c:210–248`), not the working directory.

## Unsigned modules do load in sudo

`openpam_dynamic.c:70–124` (`openpam_dlopen`): if `dlopen` of a readable module
fails and the process enforces library validation, OpenPAM clears it with
`csops(CS_OPS_CLEAR_LV)` and retries. For that call to succeed the process needs
an entitlement; Apple DTS stated that sudo has it
([developer forums thread 729622](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/729622),
May 2023: sudo "opts out of library validation" to load PAM modules). Reading
sudo's entitlements needs root (`/usr/bin/sudo` is mode 4511), so this project did
not check them directly.

Observed: the ad-hoc-signed module built by `clang` loads in `/usr/bin/sudo` on
macOS 26.6.2. A second report on the same version:
[Homebrew discussion #6597](https://github.com/orgs/Homebrew/discussions/6597)
(2026-08-27: a self-built module "works well (at least on Tahoe 26.6.2)" in sudo).
The same discussion shows `sshd-session` rejecting third-party modules on macOS
26, so the result is specific to sudo.

## Fallback behaviour

| Situation | Module returns | sudo then |
|---|---|---|
| Touch ID approved | `PAM_SUCCESS` | runs the command |
| Cancel / "Use Password" | `PAM_AUTH_ERR` | terminal password prompt (no second dialog, because `pam_tid.so` is commented out) |
| `sudo -A` | `PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL` | askpass helper |
| No GUI session (SSH) | `PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL` | terminal password prompt |
| Other account / no enrolled finger | `PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL` | terminal password prompt |

Keeping Apple's `pam_tid.so` active *after* this module would show a second
Touch ID dialog whenever the first is cancelled, which is why install comments
it out rather than stacking.

## Homebrew specifics

Homebrew calls `/usr/bin/sudo` by absolute path
(`Library/Homebrew/system_command.rb`, `sudo_prefix`), so a shell alias or
wrapper never sees it. Before its first sudo call in a run it executes
`sudo --reset-timestamp` (`Library/Homebrew/utils/sudo.sh`), discarding cached
credentials, so each run that needs root prompts again. Typical triggers are
cask `.pkg` installers (`cask/pkg.rb`), uninstall scripts and launchctl steps,
and removing root-owned files under `/Applications`. Homebrew adds `-A` when
`SUDO_ASKPASS` is set, which skips Touch ID entirely.

Its Ruby process appears as
`…/portable-ruby/current/bin/ruby -W1 --disable=gems,rubyopt …/brew.rb <args>`,
which the requester walk shows as `brew.rb <args>`.

## Testing

| Tool | Proves | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/check-reasons.sh` (via `build/reason_test`) | command parsing and requester formatting for real argv/parent shapes | nothing |
| `tests/probe_load.c` | the system libpam accepts a module or a whole policy file — the check sudo's `pam_start` performs | nothing |
| `tests/harness.c` (`just try-dialog`) | a real Touch ID dialog with the reason, outside sudo | Touch ID |
| `just try-sudo` | the installed module inside setuid sudo, including the euid switch | install |

`probe_load` calls `openpam_read_chain_from_filehandle`, an OpenPAM-internal
function the system libpam exports. It is not public API and could disappear; the
probe checks the symbol and runs a control (`pam_tid.so` must load) first, and
exits 2 rather than reporting a result if either fails. An earlier version passed
the wrong style constant (`pam_conf_style` is 0 in the enum, `pam_d_style` 1);
every line was skipped and the control returned 0, which is how the control
caught it.

## Debugging notes

- **Unified log:** the module logs under subsystem `pam_tid_context`
  (`just logs`). In zsh, `log` is a shell builtin, so `log show …` never reaches
  macOS's tool and prints nothing useful; call `/usr/bin/log`.
- `/usr/bin/log show` has rendered the module's messages as `<compose failure
  [UUID]>`: the event is recorded but the format string is not resolved. The
  LocalAuthentication and `coreauthd` lines around it are readable and were enough
  to diagnose the uid problem.
- Useful predicate while testing:
  `process == "sudo" OR process == "coreauthd" OR subsystem == "com.apple.LocalAuthentication"`.
